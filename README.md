## **main (or master): The stable, production-ready branch containing thoroughly tested code.**
## **develop: An integration branch for ongoing development, where completed features are merged before release.**
## **feature/: Branches dedicated to individual features (e.g., feature/login-screen), allowing isolated development without affecting other parts of the codebase**
## **release/: Branches for preparing new releases (e.g., release/v1.0), used for final testing and minor bug fixes before going live.**
## **hotfix/: Branches for urgent fixes created from main (e.g., hotfix/critical-bug), enabling quick resolutions to production issues without disrupting ongoing development.**
## **bugfix/: Branches for non-urgent bug fixes created from develop (e.g., bugfix/ui-glitch), addressing minor issues found during testing or development.**
